# MementoAI

## Inspiration

This assistant has been initiated to function for patients with Alzheimer’s disease or Parkinson’s disease during stage 1 and stage 2 of their treatment. People with these diseases eventually develop a habit of forgetting their daily chores. We wanted to build an assistant that can help people during these times.

## What it does

There are quite a few features that we have planned to incorporate into this model. The assistant serves to remind people of who their family members are through storing their images. The patient can ask the AI regarding who a particular person is and the AI will display the picture of the person using the images in its database. The assistant will be able to record user's conversations and store the summaries so that they might be useful at some point in the future. The AI serves as a reminder and also will be able to manage the patient's daily schedule through medications, daily chores, exercise and planning hospital visits. They will be taken as an input and will be notified to the patient through vocal notifications when it is time. Hospital visits are planned depending on the level of information the patient can remember.

## How we built it

Python was the main language that we have used for this project. We've planned to make the assistant by integrating the different features of the product in individual environments.
